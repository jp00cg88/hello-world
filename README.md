The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. 
It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. 
Let’s get started with GitHub!  
You’ll learn how to:
 
* Create and use a repository
* Start and manage a new branch
* Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
* Open and merge a pull request
